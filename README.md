## 🌟 What is this project?

Welcome to the **Student Academic Performance API**!  
Predict student outcomes with the power of machine learning! 🎓  
Built with **Python** & **FastAPI** for blazing speed.  
Currently, the API is **available locally only** for testing and development purposes.

## 📊 Dataset & Analysis

- 📚 **Dataset sourced from Kaggle:**  
  We use a well-known student academic performance dataset pulled directly from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), containing various features related to student demographics, grades, and academic background.
- 🔎 **Data Analysis Performed:**  
  Extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) was carried out, examining correlations, distributions, and trends.
- 🛠️ **Frameworks and Libraries Used:**
  - 🐼 [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data manipulation and cleaning
  - 🧮 [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) for numerical operations
  - 📊 [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) for data visualization
  - 🤖 [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) for machine learning modeling

## 🧠 Powered by ML Models

- 🌲 **RandomForestClassifier**
- 🌳 **ExtraTreesClassifier**
- 🏆 **XGBClassifier**

These models work together to deliver accurate predictions for academic performance.
